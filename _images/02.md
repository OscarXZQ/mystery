title: The Black Lacquered Flute
caption: The Black Lacquered Flute is a long flute made of ebony wood, coated with a deep black lacquer without any decorations or carvings. The sound of the flute is extremely pleasant, but only those with strong greed and desires can play its music. The flute has the power to manipulate human emotions, gradually consuming the player's soul with darkness. When played, the Black Lacquered Flute emits sound waves similar to dark energy, inducing hypnotic and controlling effects on those around it. After the player's soul is completely consumed, the flute turns them into a monster unable to control their desires.
