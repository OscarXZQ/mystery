title: The Black Hat - Ozryas
caption: This is a black hat that looks ordinary, but it possesses strange powers. When a person wears the hat and begins to tell lies, it emits a strong light that clears the wearer's mind, causing them to completely lose their sense of identity and surroundings. The wearer of the hat begins to experience hallucinations and enters a world where reality and fantasy are indistinguishable, and they cannot escape on their own. In this world, the wearer repeats their lies until they fully believe them to be true.
